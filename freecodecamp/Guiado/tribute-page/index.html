            <h3>Here is a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="data">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><span class="data">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to study at the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Great Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><span class="data">1935</span> - Has to interrupt his studies to save money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them," he said. "All of this left marks on me."</li>
                <li><span class="data">1937</span> - Graduates from university and gets a job with the US Forest Service</li>
                <li><span class="data">1938</span> - Marries Margret Gibson, with whom he will live for 69 years. Loses his job due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, returns to school to study under him, learning about breeding pest-resistant plants.</li>
                <li><span class="data">1941</span> - Tries to enlist in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack but is rejected. Instead, the military asks his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT for malaria control, disinfectants, and other applied research.</li>
                <li><span class="data">1942</span> - Earns a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><span class="data">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to lead a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team develops 6,000 different strains of disease-resistant wheat, adapted to different climates.</li>
                <li><span class="data">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice per season, doubling production</li>
                <li><span class="data">1953</span> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf wheat variety with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizers. This variety goes on to account for 95% of Mexico's wheat production.</li>
                <li><span class="data">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and introduces his high-yielding wheat strains to the Indian subcontinent, helping to mitigate mass starvation due to rapid population growth</li>
                <li><span class="data">1970</span> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><span class="data">1983</span> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                <li><span class="data">1984</span> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><span class="data">2005</span> - Declares: "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way to meet the demand, as we are running out of arable land. States that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were already selecting the best varieties."</li>
                <li><span class="data">2009</span> - Dies at the age of 95</li>
            </ul>

                "Borlaug's life and achievements are a testimony to the far-reaching contributions that one man's towering intellect, persistence, and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
